# üêß Seaborn Visualization Practice

This repository contains examples of all important **Seaborn plots**.  
Each script shows how to create different graphs using the **Penguins dataset** (`penguins.csv`).

It‚Äôs made for beginners who want to learn **data visualization with Python** step by step.

## üìä Seaborn Plots ‚Äì When and Why to Use

| Plot Name | When to Use | Simple Example |
|------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Line Plot** | When you want to show how a value changes over time or order. | Example: Show how temperature changes during the week. |
| **Histogram** | When you want to see how numeric values are spread (distribution). | Example: See how many penguins have body mass between 3000‚Äì4000g. |
| **Bar Plot** | When you want to compare different categories. | Example: Compare average body mass of each penguin species. |
| **Scatter Plot** | When you want to see the relationship between two numeric values. | Example: Compare bill length vs bill depth. |
| **Heatmap** | When you want to show values or correlations in a matrix form. | Example: Show correlation between all numeric columns. |
| **Count Plot** | When you want to count how many items exist in each category. | Example: Count number of male and female penguins. |
| **Violin Plot** | When you want to see data distribution and density for each category. | Example: Compare body mass distribution of each species. |
| **Pair Plot** | When you want to see all numeric relationships at once. | Example: Show relations between bill length, depth, and body mass. |
| **Box Plot** | When you want to show median, range, and outliers in numeric data. | Example: Show flipper length summary for each species. |
| **Strip Plot** | When you want to display each data point across categories. | Example: Show all penguin body mass points by species. |
| **Cat Plot** | When you want to create categorical plots (bar, box, etc.) easily. | Example: Show average flipper length per island using catplot. |
| **FacetGrid** | When you want to draw multiple plots for different groups. | Example: Show separate scatter plots for each species. |
| **Styling & Themes** | When you want to change colors, themes, or style of your plots. | Example: Apply dark theme and custom color palette. |
